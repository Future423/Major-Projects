# PG Hive

## Overview

**PG Hive** is a desktop-based application built with Python and Tkinter, designed to streamline the process of searching for and listing Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. Tailored for students and working professionals, this software bridges the gap between PG owners and seekers by offering a simple, efficient, and free-to-use platform. PG owners can log in, upload, and manage their PG listings, while seekers can explore verified accommodations based on their needs.

With PG Hive, the traditional hassle of finding safe and reliable PG stays is eliminated. The system maintains a verified database, ensuring that seekers access only authentic listings, while owners gain an easy channel to reach potential tenants.

## Features

The application enables PG owners to create accounts, securely log in, and upload or update PG details including amenities and contact information. Each listing is subject to verification before being published, ensuring reliability for seekers. On the other side, users looking for a PG can perform searches without any fees, browsing through verified properties and directly connecting with PG owners.

The user interface is built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, offering a clean, image-based navigation system with menu options for Home, Login, Signup, and Seeker pages. A combination of intuitive design and functional controls makes the platform easy to use even for first-time users.

Behind the scenes, all data is stored securely on an online SQL server, enabling real-time updates and ensuring data consistency. This database structure helps manage user accounts, listings, and search queries efficiently, offering a smooth experience for both PG owners and seekers.

## Benefits

By using PG Hive, PG owners gain a dedicated platform to reach verified seekers while maintaining full control over their listings. The verification process adds a layer of trust, ensuring only genuine accommodations are displayed. Seekers benefit from a clutter-free search experience, accessing only verified PGs and getting direct contact information, leading to faster and safer accommodation arrangements.

The application is entirely free to use, with no hidden charges for either PG owners or seekers. Its lightweight design ensures it runs smoothly on most systems, requiring only Python and a few additional libraries. By bringing both sides onto a common, verified platform, PG Hive saves time, reduces effort, and improves the overall efficiency of the PG search process.
